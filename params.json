{"name":"OCSlimProject","tagline":"The lightweight Xcode project template for creating fast, rock solid, non UI based Acceptance Tests using Fitnesse","body":"![CI Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/paulstringer/OCSlimProject.svg?style=flat)\r\n![Version](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/OCSlimProject.svg?style=flat)\r\n![License](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/l/OCSlimProject.svg?style=flat)\r\n![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/OCSlimProject.svg?style=flat)\r\n\r\nOCSlimProject is a lightweight Xcode project template and set of scripts for creating fast, rock solid, non UI based Acceptance Tests on iOS and OS X using [Fitnesse](http://fitnesse.org).\r\n\r\nCheck out the [video from NSLondon](http://stringerstheory.net/nslondon-video/) to see it in action.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### How to Use\r\n\r\n* Download OCSlimProject\r\n* Run ```$ make```. This adds the Xcode project templates for creating Acceptance Test targets within Xcode (iOS & OS X).\r\n* Add an 'AcceptanceTests' target to your Project using the _Acceptance Test_ templates now installed under the Test project categories\r\n* Using CocoaPods link _OCSlimProject_ to your _AcceptanceTests_ target with the following Podfile entry\r\n    \r\n```\r\n    target 'AcceptanceTests' do\r\n\t    pod 'OCSlimProject'\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Run either ```pod install``` or  ```pod update``` as needed\r\n* Build the _AcceptanceTests_ target to generate the Application (repeat this after each code change)\r\n* Launch Fitnesse by running the script ```./LaunchFitnesse``` that's generated automatically in your project's root directory\r\n* Follow the prompt to download [Fitnesse](http://www.fitnesse.org/FitNesseDownload) to the  root of your project\r\n* Copy the folder at OCSlimProject/Example/FitNesseRoot/OCSlimProjectExamplePage into your project's FitNesseRoot folder\r\n* With Fitnesse running now check out the [OCSlimProjectExamplePage](http://localhost:8080/OCSlimProjectExamplePage).\r\n* You're now ready to start writing [Acceptance tests and Fixtures](http://stringerstheory.net/acceptance-testing-with-ios/)  in Obj-C or Swift and excercising them with Fitnesse.\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\nThe owner of this repository takes no credit for the following included resources (except for the ones credited to the owner). This is a convienient lightweight wrapper either inspired by or using these resources together with some project glue automating the process of creating 'ocslim' based Apps for use with Fitnesse. \r\n\r\n### OCSlim, RunTestsTargetWithSlimPort\r\nCreated by: Erik Meyer, 8th Light <https://blog.8thlight.com/eric-meyer/archive.html>\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/ericmeyer/ObjectiveCSlim>\r\n<https://github.com/dougbradbury/cslim/tree/ocslim>\r\n\r\n### ios-sim\r\nCreated by: Phonegap, <http://phonegap.com>\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim>\r\n\r\n### exportenv.sh\r\nCreated by: Jon Reid, <http://qualitycoding.org/>\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/jonreid/XcodeCoverage>\r\n\r\n### Xcode Project Templates, LaunchFitnesse\r\nCreated by: Paul Stringer, <http://stringerstheory.net>\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/paulstringer/Slim-iOS-TestRunner>\r\n\r\n##### License\r\nOCSlimProject is available under the MIT license.
